# Fluvia (powered by JS-GEMS)

## Overview
Fluvia is a high‑performance geomorphological modelling system implementing hydraulic and thermal erosion processes urilising a 2.5D Lagrangian droplet approach.

The simulator includes:
- a real‑time rendering pipeline
- an interactive parameter‑tuning GUI
- a built‑in media recorder for exporting images and video files of the terrain

Fluvia is powered by my JS‑GEMS (JavaScript Geomorphological Modelling System) mocrl, and its core erosion methodology is based on work by Nick McDonald, rearchitected and adapted for an interactive and browser-centric geomorphology application.
