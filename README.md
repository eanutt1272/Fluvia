# Fluvia (powered by JS-GEMS)

## Overview
Fluvia is a high‑performance, browser-based geomorphological modelling system implementing hydraulic and thermal erosion processes utilising a 2.5D Lagrangian droplet approach.

The program includes:
- a real‑time rendering pipeline
- an interactive parameter‑tuning GUI
- a built‑in media recorder for exporting images and video files of the terrain

Fluvia is powered by my JS‑GEMS (JavaScript Geomorphological Modelling System) model, and its core erosion algorithms are based on research and work by Nick McDonald, rearchitected and adapted for an interactive and browser-centric geomorphology application.
